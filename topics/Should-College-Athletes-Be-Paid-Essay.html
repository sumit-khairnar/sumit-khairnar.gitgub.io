                I believe a college athletes' hard work and dedication shouldn't receive any kind monetary compensation, only due to the fact colleges pay for their tuition, books, and room and board. A typical struggling college student works just as hard as any college-athlete does. But free education, free books, and all room and board paid for? This seems almost unfair and is prejudice. Paying college-athletes sounds so preposterous, and it is. None of this is to say that a system like this would ever be created to work. It's not easy to decide whether this will happen anytime soon due to the ramifications to figure out how to make this a civilized system.</p>

                The most crucial point made so far about a product’s performance in the real time is largely based on product or consumer testing.

With that being said, what does it mean to be an athlete? Does it simply mean that you play a sport, or you participate on a sports team, or does it mean something more than that? The word athlete does not have a single simple answer, but has a complex meaning that is taken further beyond the point of just playing a sport</p>

                ?

                I think college athletes should be paid just like professional athletes. College athletes do the 
                same thing proffesional athletes do but just at a lower level.

But very few high school players get the opportunity to step foot and play on a Division I or II field and the honor of doing so is payment enough. Therefore, college football players should not be paid because the players are getting paid enough with scholarships and it would cross the line of amateurism.
